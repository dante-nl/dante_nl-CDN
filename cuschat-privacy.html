	<h2 id="information-we-collect">Information we collect</h2>
	<p>We only collect data that you give us directly, such as when you send a message or enter a chat. All of this data can be accessed using our API and services that may interact with it, such as <a href="https://archyve.dantenl.tk">Archyve</a>, a wesbsite created by us to demonstrate the API.</p>
	<p>You are unable to turn this off, since it is required for Cuschat to function as Cuschat uses the data available in the API. You can basically see the Cuschat website as a wrapper for the Cuschat API.</p>
	<p>When you sign in with Google, we still know basically nothing about you. This is what we know:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Your first name and last name</li>
		<li>Your unique Google ID</li>
		<li>Your profile picture</li>
		<li>The language you set your Google account to</li>
	</ol>
	<p>And from that list we only use the first two items. When chatting while logged in, only your first name is visible.</p>
	<h2 id="information-we-store">Information we store</h2>
	<p>All in formation is stored temporarily. In the case of the main chat, for less than 24 hours. For the rooms that have a room code: as long as the room is active. Every hour we check what rooms had recent activity, and the ones that fail this simple check get <strong>permanently removed from the database</strong>. We do not store any data after deletion. If you don&#39;t see it, it&#39;s because it&#39;s not there. Nowhere, not even in a secret deleted items folder.
	This is also the case with user rooms, although these get cleared after a week of inactivity.</p>
	<h2 id="changes-to-this-privacy-policy">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
	<p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or to comply with legal requirements. When we update the policy, we will revise the &quot;last updated&quot; date at the top of the policy and publish it on our website. We encourage you to review the privacy policy periodically to stay informed about our collection, use, and sharing of your information.</p>
